[00:01:28.104] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

[00:03:07.714] Browser ERROR   unhandledRejection: Error: 
Clerk: The <SignIn/> component is not configured correctly. The most likely reasons for this error are:

1. The "/sign-in" route is not a catch-all route.
It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "/sign-in/[[...rest]]/page.tsx". Alternatively, you can update the <SignIn/> component to use hash-based routing by setting the "routing" prop to "hash".

2. The <SignIn/> component is mounted in a catch-all route, but all routes under "/sign-in" are protected by the middleware.
To resolve this, ensure that the middleware does not protect the catch-all route or any of its children. If you are using the "createRouteMatcher" helper, consider adding "(.*)" to the end of the route pattern, eg: "/sign-in(.*)". For more information, see: https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware#create-route-matcher
